Model Summary Based on Task Complexity
Easiest (Basic Prediction/Forecasting): Polynomial Regression or Linear Regression (Voltage or Power Prediction based on RPM).
Moderate (Anomaly Detection/Environmental Control): K-Nearest Neighbors for Anomaly Detection; Polynomial Regression for servo adjustment.
Advanced (Maintenance Prediction/Time Series): Random Forest or Gradient Boosted Trees for maintenance prediction; LSTM for power generation forecasting.
